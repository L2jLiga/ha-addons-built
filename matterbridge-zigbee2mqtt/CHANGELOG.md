<h3>Home Assistant Community Add-ons</h3>
<p>The Home Assistant Community Add-ons and plugins are not verified to
work with Matterbridge. I strongly advise against using them. If you do
use them and encounter an issue (which is likely because some do not
meet the Matterbridge guidelines), please do not open an issue in the
Matterbridge repository.</p>
